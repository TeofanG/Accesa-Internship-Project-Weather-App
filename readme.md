Weather Anywhere is a web application built in Html5, CSS and Vanilla Javascript that allows users view the current weather in a specific location. 
This project was made for Accesa & RaRo 2023 Internship (technical evaluation). 

List with the implemented functionalities:

- viewing weather information in any location (temperature, humidity, wind speed etc.);
- adding a location to favorite;
- specific themes and designs depending on time of the day and weather status (day/night, rain, snow etc.)
